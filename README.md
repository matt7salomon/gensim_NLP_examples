1.	Text Preprocessing:
	•	Tokenizes the text, removes punctuation and stop words, and converts the text to lowercase.
	•	Preprocessing is done using NLTK’s word_tokenize and stopwords.
2.	Dictionary and Corpus Creation:
	•	A Gensim dictionary maps each word in the corpus to a unique ID.
	•	The corpus is created as a bag-of-words representation, where each document is converted into a list of (word_id, frequency) tuples.
3.	LDA Model Training:
	•	The LDA model is trained on the bag-of-words corpus to extract 2 topics from the documents.
	•	The passes=10 parameter controls the number of iterations over the entire corpus, increasing accuracy.
4.	New Document Inference:
	•	You can apply the trained LDA model to new, unseen documents to get the topic distribution (how much each topic contributes to the document).
5.	Coherence Score:
	•	The coherence score is computed to evaluate the quality of the topics generated by the LDA model. A higher coherence score indicates better topic quality.
